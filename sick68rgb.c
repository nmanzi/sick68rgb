/*
The first part, // Key Matrix to LED Index, tells the system what key this LED represents by using the key's electrical matrix row & col.
The second part, // LED Index to Physical Position represents the LED's physical { x, y } position on the keyboard.
The default expected range of values for { x, y } is the inclusive range { 0..224, 0..64 }.
This default expected range is due to effects that calculate the center of the keyboard for their animations.
The easiest way to calculate these positions is imagine your keyboard is a grid, and the top left of the keyboard represents { x, y }
coordinate { 0, 0 } and the bottom right of your keyboard represents { 224, 64 }.

Using this as a basis, you can use the following formula to calculate the physical position:

x = 224 / (NUMBER_OF_COLS - 1) * COL_POSITION
y =  64 / (NUMBER_OF_ROWS - 1) * ROW_POSITION

Where NUMBER_OF_COLS, NUMBER_OF_ROWS, COL_POSITION, & ROW_POSITION are all based on the physical layout of your keyboard, not the electrical layout.
